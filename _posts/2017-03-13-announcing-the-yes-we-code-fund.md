<p>This weekend at SXSW, we had the honor of sitting alongside leaders from DreamCorps, #YesWeCode, TechHire and TechSquare Labs to announce that applications for the newly renamed <a href="http://www.yeswecodefund.com">#YesWeCode Fund</a> are now live.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The #YesWeCode Fund was initially </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched as the <a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/2016/09/09/announcing-tech-opportunity-fund/" target="_blank">Tech Opportunity Fund</a> in September 2016 and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a collaboration between </span><a href="http://www.theironyard.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iron Yard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.codefellows.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code Fellows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://operationhope.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation HOPE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://opportunityhub.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunity Ecosystem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.climbcredit.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climb Credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://techsquare.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechSquare Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://wecancodeit.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We Can Code IT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.yeswecode.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#YesWeCode</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By unifying the efforts of code schools, government, civic organizations and employers, the goal of the Fund is to increase diversity in the tech industry by removing financial barriers and increasing access to tech education. </span></p>
<p>This is a huge goal and we are proud to be a part of the solution. Our CEO, Peter Barth said it best: <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Creating an inclusive tech workforce can only be achieved if all stakeholders in the tech sector are represented in the solution. By uniting the efforts of employers, educators, government and civic organizations in the Fund, we can both inspire people who are currently underrepresented in the industry to choose tech as a career and empower them to pursue that goal through a full-tuition scholarship to attend a code school.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Over the next five years, the #YesWeCode Fund aims to award $100 million in diversity scholarships to women and
minority students who are currently underrepresented in the tech workforce. We have committed $40 million in full-tuition scholarships to attend our immersive programs, and Code Fellows and We Can Code IT </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have also committed to providing scholarships to attend their bootcamp courses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>We are so excited to be working with such fantastic organizations around the country, and cannot wait to meet the new students who will have the opportunity to learn to code and pursue a career in tech through the Fund.</p>
