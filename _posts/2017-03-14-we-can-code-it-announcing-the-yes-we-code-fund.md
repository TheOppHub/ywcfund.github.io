<p><b>CLEVELAND, Ohio &#8212; March 13, 2017 &#8212;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We Can Code IT is the premier coding boot camp in Cleveland and Columbus with a mission to increase diversity in the tech industry. They are proud to announce their partnership in the </span><a href="https://www.yeswecode.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#YesWeCode</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fund for women and minorities. The new scholarship was announced on Saturday in Austin, Texas at the </span><a href="http://opportunityhub.co/2017hbcusxsw/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 HBCU@SXSW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (South by Southwest), an incubator of cutting-edge technologies and digital creativity in partnership with several Historically Black Colleges and Universities.</span><span id="more-6126"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The #YesWeCode fund aims to award $100 million in full-tuition scholarships over the next five years for women and minorities to attend code school and pursue careers in technology. Initially </span><a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/09/prweb13673546.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched as the Tech Opportunity Fund in September 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the fund is a collaboration between </span><a href="http://www.theironyard.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iron Yard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <a href="https://wecancodeit.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We Can Code IT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="http://www.codefellows.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code Fellows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://operationhope.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation HOPE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://opportunityhub.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunity Ecosystem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.climbcredit.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climb Credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://techsquare.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechSquare Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  and </span><a href="https://www.yeswecode.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#YesWeCode</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Dream Corps initiative helping connect 100,000 underrepresented minorities to careers in technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unifying the efforts of code schools, government, civic organizations and employers, the goal of the #YesWeCode Fund is to increase diversity in the tech industry by removing financial barriers and increasing access to tech education. In addition to technical skills training, the initiative will include core financial literacy education and entrepreneurship training through programming partner Operation HOPE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We Can Code IT is a perfect partner for the #YesWeCode fund because we’ve created coding bootcamp academies where women and minorities feel understood and welcomed,” says Leslie Evans, President of We Can Code IT. Her organization is offering a full tuition scholarship in each of their classes or “cohorts” in Cleveland and Columbus for the next five years.  After being accepted as a student at We Can Code IT, interested students can apply at </span><a href="http://www.yeswecodefund.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.yeswecodefund.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re honored to partner with The Iron Yard and other well-respected organizations,” says Mel McGee, founder and CEO of We Can Code IT. “The #YesWeCode fund is a really exciting way to close the gap and literally change the face of the tech industry. We want to create promising futures for people you don’t normally see in software development and computer programming.” McGee says the #YesWeCode Fund also meets the booming demand of organizations and businesses hungry for more diversity and the innovation it brings to IT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iron Yard has committed $40 million in full-tuition scholarships to the school’s immersive programs, Code Fellows has committed $5 million and We Can Code IT will offer $1 million in full-tuition scholarships.  Operation HOPE will serve as the Fund’s financial literacy and entrepreneur training partner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reach the goal of awarding $100 million in scholarships, the </span><a href="http://www.yeswecodefund.com/partners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fund is calling for</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> employers, code schools and civic organizations across the country to join the effort by providing funding for scholarships and contributing resources that will support scholarship recipients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Creating an inclusive tech workforce can only be achieved if all stakeholders in the tech sector are represented in the solution,&#8221; said Peter Barth, CEO of The Iron Yard. &#8220;By uniting the efforts of employers, educators, government and civic organizations in the Fund, we can both inspire people who are currently underrepresented in the industry to choose tech as a career and empower them to pursue that goal through a full-tuition scholarship to attend a code school.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Access to opportunity is the hallmark of an inclusive economy,” said John Hope Bryant, Operation HOPE Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer. “This extraordinary collaborative will help develop life skills in deserving students, many, in underserved communities throughout the nation—creating a generation of tech leaders and job creators to power us forward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications for #YesWeCode Fund scholarships are now open. To receive a scholarship, applicants will need to first be accepted into a participating code school, including We Can Code IT, through that program’s standard admissions process. Students will then receive a link to apply for the scholarship from the participating program. Scholarships will be awarded to qualified students on a first come, first served basis.</span></p>
