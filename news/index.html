                <h2><a href="/press/diversity/scholarship/2017/03/15/press-release-announcing-fund.html">$100 Million #YesWeCode Fund to Improve Diversity in Tech; Applications Now Open for Code School Scholarships</a></h2>
            </header>
            <section>
                <div class="post-content"><p> The partners from the Tech Opportunity Fund and #YesWeCode, announced that applications for the newly renamed <a href="http://www.yeswecodefund.com" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow">#YesWeCode Fund</a> are now open. The announcement was made on Saturday at a luncheon panel hosted by Van Jones, Founder of Dream Corps and #YesWeCode, at the 2017 HBCU@SXSW. Additional panelists included Tess Posner, Managing Director of TechHire; Sam Kapila, Director of Academic Operations &amp; Diversity at The Iron Yard; Derrick Morgan, Co-Founder of Huddle Ventures; Rodney Sampson, partner at TechSquare Labs; and John Hope Bryant, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Operation HOPE. </p>
<p>The #YesWeCode Fund, initially launched as the <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/09/prweb13673546.htm" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow">Tech Opportunity Fund</a> in September 2016, is a collaboration between The Iron Yard, Code Fellows, Operation HOPE, Opportunity Ecosystem, Climb Credit, TechSquare Labs, We Can Code IT and #YesWeCode. By unifying the efforts of code schools, government, civic organizations and employers, the goal of the Fund is to increase diversity in the tech industry by removing financial barriers and increasing access to tech education. In addition to technical skills training, the initiative will include core financial literacy education and entrepreneurship training through Operation HOPE. </p>
<p>“The tech divide requires a collaborative effort to close the gap between the underrepresented who want a more promising future and the companies requiring a much-needed change in the makeup of the industry,” said Felix Flores, Jr., National Director of #YesWeCode. “The #YesWeCode Fund models how the fight for social justice and tech innovation can be a synergistic win for all. We’re honored to partner with The Iron Yard and TechSquare Labs to take our work to nearly 20 cities in the near future to help maintain the tech industry as the pioneers of innovative and positive change.”</p>
<p>#YesWeCode is a Dream Corps initiative that works with partners to help connect 100,000 underrepresented minorities to careers in technology. The program accelerates access to training in high-demand technical and non-technical skills to prepare untapped talent to enter the tech-fueled economy. #YesWeCode works to build a diverse pipeline of &#39;homegrown&#39; tech talent to meet demand and boost local economies.</p>
<p>“SXSW represents the global innovation economy and to go live with a diversity and inclusion initiative of this magnitude during our HBCU@SXSW experience is epic,” said Rodney Sampson, a partner of the Fund and partner at Opportunity Ecosystem and TechSquare Labs. “What started as a conversation during a TechHire event in Atlanta between Peter Barth, CEO of The Iron Yard, Megan Smith, former Chief Technology Office of the U.S., and myself, is now a reality. Together, we will train and support thousands of new software engineers who otherwise might not have been able to pursue a career in tech.”</p>
<p>Over the next five years, the #YesWeCode Fund aims to award $100 million in diversity scholarships to women and minority students who are currently underrepresented in the tech workforce. The Iron Yard has committed $40 million in full-tuition scholarships to the school’s immersive programs, Code Fellows has committed $5 million in scholarships, We Can Code IT will offer $1 million in full-tuition scholarships, and Operation HOPE will serve as the Fund’s financial literacy and entrepreneur training partner. To reach the goal of awarding $100 million in scholarships, <a href="http://www.yeswecodefund.com/partners/">the Fund is calling for</a> employers, code schools and civic organizations across the country to join the effort by providing funding for scholarships and contributing resources that will support scholarship recipients.</p>
<p>&quot;Creating an inclusive tech workforce can only be achieved if all stakeholders in the tech sector are represented in the solution,&quot; said Peter Barth, CEO of The Iron Yard. &quot;By uniting the efforts of employers, educators, government and civic organizations in the Fund, we can both inspire people who are currently underrepresented in the industry to choose tech as a career and empower them to pursue that goal through a full-tuition scholarship to attend a code school.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Access to opportunity is the hallmark of an inclusive economy,” Bryant said. “This extraordinary collaborative will help develop life skills in deserving students, many, in underserved communities throughout the nation—creating a generation of tech leaders and job creators to power us forward.”</p>
<p>Applications for #YesWeCode Fund scholarships are now open. To receive a scholarship, applicants will need to first be accepted into a participating code school through that program’s standard admissions process. Students will then receive a link to apply for the scholarship from the participating program. Scholarships will be awarded to qualified students on a first come, first served basis.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re honored to partner with The Iron Yard and other well-respected organizations,” says Mel McGee, founder and CEO of We Can Code IT. “The #YesWeCode fund is a really exciting way to close the gap and literally change the face of the tech industry.

<p>This weekend at SXSW, we had the honor of sitting alongside leaders from DreamCorps, #YesWeCode, TechHire and TechSquare Labs to announce that applications for the newly renamed <a href="http://www.yeswecodefund.com">#YesWeCode Fund</a> are now live.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The #YesWeCode Fund was initially </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched as the <a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/2016/09/09/announcing-tech-opportunity-fund/" target="_blank">Tech Opportunity Fund</a> in September 2016 and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a collaboration between </span><a href="http://www.theironyard.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iron Yard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.codefellows.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code Fellows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://operationhope.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation HOPE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://opportunityhub.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunity Ecosystem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.climbcredit.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climb Credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://techsquare.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechSquare Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://wecancodeit.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We Can Code IT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.yeswecode.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#YesWeCode</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By unifying the efforts of code schools, government, civic organizations and employers, the goal of the Fund is to increase diversity in the tech industry by removing financial barriers and increasing access to tech education. </span></p>
<p>This is a huge goal and we are proud to be a part of the solution. Our CEO, Peter Barth said it best: <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Creating an inclusive tech workforce can only be achieved if all stakeholders in the tech sector are represented in the solution. By uniting the efforts of employers, educators, government and civic organizations in the Fund, we can both inspire people who are currently underrepresented in the industry to choose tech as a career and empower them to pursue that goal through a full-tuition scholarship to attend a code school.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Over the next five years, the #YesWeCode Fund aims to award $100 million in diversity scholarships to women and
minority students who are currently underrepresented in the tech workforce. We have committed $40 million in full-tuition scholarships to attend our immersive programs, and Code Fellows and We Can Code IT &lt;/span&gt;<span style="font-weight: 400;">have also committed to providing scholarships to attend their bootcamp courses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>We are so excited to be working with such fantastic organizations around the country, and cannot wait to meet the new students who will have the opportunity to learn to code and pursue a career in tech through the Fund.</p>

<p><b>WASHINGTON &#8211; (September 9, 2016) &#8211;</b><a href="http://www.theironyard.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iron Yard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the largest immersive code school in the U.S., today launched the </span><a href="http://www.techopportunityfund.org" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech Opportunity Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in collaboration with with </span><a href="https://www.codefellows.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code Fellows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.operationhope.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation HOPE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">By unifying</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the efforts of code schools, government, civic organizations and employers, the goal of the Tech Opportunity Fund is to increase diversity in the tech industry by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">removing financial barriers and increasing access to tech education for all. In addition to technical skills training, the initiative will include core financial literacy education and entrepreneurship training through programming partner Operation HOPE. The Tech Opportunity Fund was mentioned this morning in a speech by Vice President Joe Biden in St. Louis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To maximize the potential of the tech industry, we must maximize the potential of a diverse tech workforce,” said Peter Barth, CEO of The Iron Yard. “The Tech Opportunity Fund builds off of the momentum generated by innovative initiatives like TechHire to ensure Americans of all backgrounds have access to tech training programs that can open the door to a career in tech. There is a true need in the industry for an organization to unite the many groups that are working toward this goal and by coordinating our efforts, we can truly change the industry for the better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next five years, the Tech Opportunity Fund aims to award $100 million in diversity scholarships to in-need students from groups that are currently underrepresented in the tech workforce including women and minorities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iron Yard has committed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $40 million in full-tuition scholarships to the school’s immersive programs over the next five years, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code Fellows has committed $5 million in full-tuition scholarships, and Operation HOPE will serve as the Fund’s financial literacy and entrepreneur training partner. To reach the goal of awarding $100 million in scholarships, the Tech Opportunity Fund is calling on employers, code schools and civic organizations across the country to join the Fund by providing funding for scholarships and contributing resources that will support for scholarship recipients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The creation of the Tech Opportunity Fund is unprecedented,” said Rodney Sampson, a</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">partner of the Tech Opportunity Fund and partner at TechSquare Labs. “By far, it is the largest tangible strategic financial commitment to diversify the technical talent and workforce that will drive our nation toward an inclusive innovation economy for all. I look forward to working with all of the stakeholders to ensure that these scholarships are distributed with integrity and authenticity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to providing full-tuition scholarships to code school programs, the Tech Opportunity Fund will work to remove other barriers that can prevent people from pursuing a code school education. Partnerships with city-level government bodies and civic organizations will assist scholarship recipients by addressing needs such as affordable housing, financial literacy, counseling and transportation as needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no one-size-fits-all solution that will increase access to tech education and improve diversity in the workforce,” said Barth. “The Tech Opportunity Fund approaches these issues holistically and coordinates local and national resources to provide students with both academic opportunity and the support system they need to be successful.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Access to opportunity is the hallmark of an inclusive global economy, and access to digital opportunity and jobs in the digital space is the door to the future,” said John Hope Bryant, Operation HOPE Founder, Chairman and CEO. “This extraordinary collaborative will help develop life skills in deserving students, many, in underserved communities throughout the nation—creating a generation of tech leaders and job creators to power us forward.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications for Tech Opportunity Fund scholarships will open by January 2017. To receive a scholarship, applicants will need to first be accepted into a participating code school through that program’s standard admissions process. After their acceptance, students will apply for a Tech Opportunity Fund scholarship through the website, </span><a href="http://www.techopportunityfund.org" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.techopportunityfund.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Scholarships will be awarded to qualified students on a first come, first served basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the last 12 months, we’ve provided over $600,000 in scholarships, from direct funds and from great partners like Expedia and Zillow Group. These funds have given over a hundred students the chance to learn relevant, highly desirable skills, and continue on to join great companies in the local tech markets,” said Dave Parker, Code Fellows CEO. “The Tech Opportunity Fund program helps us expand that impact.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scholarships will be available on all of The Iron Yard and Code Fellows’ campuses:</span></p>

<p><b><i>About Operation HOPE</i></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1992, Operation HOPE has been moving America from civil rights to &#8220;silver rights&#8221; with the mission of making free enterprise and capitalism work for the underserved. Through its core programs, the nonprofit has provided financial dignity and economic empowerment to over 2.6 million individuals worldwide, and $2 billion in economic activity for the disenfranchised—turning check cashing customers into banking customers, renters into homeowners, small business dreamers into small business owners and minimum wage workers into living wage consumers.  Project 5117 is HOPE’s multi-year four-pronged approach to combating economic inequality that aims to improve financial literacy, increase business role models and business internships for youth, and stabilize the American dream by boosting credit scores. Operation HOPE recently received its second consecutive 4-star charity rating for fiscal management and commitment to transparency and accountability by the prestigious non-profit evaluator, Charity Navigator—further establishing it as a best-in-class organization.
